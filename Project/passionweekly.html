             Welcome to What’s My Passion Weekly! In the process of finding a passion, and ultimately start a passion project, I’ll need to start trying new things, and revisiting old things I haven’t done in a while. With this segment I will be writing about all the activities I’ve tried to pursue throughout the week, how I feel about them and whether I view them as a passion project personally. Some things may not stick for me, but they might stick for you. Let’s start finding or passion!

                This maybe cheating, but I will consider this (blog) my first passion pursuit. I’ve always wanted to develop my own website, and this is perfect opportunity to do it. There are so many ways to be creative with your website and blog, from developing it, designing it, and creating content. I’ve always been interested in developing a website, utilizing my coding knowledge, and designing utilizing my graphic design knowledge, but if you’re not keen on either of those things, and you want to make content there are so many platforms that allow you to do just that.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I personally want to try and do all of the nitty gritty from the website development to the designing. This could potentially be a great way for me to be creative in a lot of different ways. I have a pretty basic knowledge in coding, but I am actively taking classes to get better. I’ve done graphic design before, but I haven’t done it in a while. This opportunity seems like the right time to get better at both these skills. This could also help me out careers wise (Not that a passion project has to connect to your career goals) but I do hope to be in the digital marketing space, so enhancing my skill would definitely be a plus.   
            </p>
            <p> 
                So how do I feel about this passion pursuit? Well, I see a lot of potential, this could definitely help me in a lot of ways in terms of self-fulfillment, and  enhanced creativity, and I already have an interest in what it takes to create and manage a website. BUT commitment is key to this, so we’ll see. If you’re still reading these blogs than I’d say this passion pursuit is a success.

                I always enjoyed reading as a kid, honestly sometimes more than watching television. I used to remember 11-year-old me staying until 4 AM just to finish a good book. I don’t know what happened to that girl, but I really want to get back to that.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I all honestly, I can’t even remember the last time I finished a book that wasn’t for  a class, and even in that regard I still don’t think I’ve finished one. This makes me kind of sad because I remember the joy and excitement of cracking open a good book and spending my free time just reading. I want to do that again. Also, part of why I want to start reading more, is because I want to try harder to get off technology and expand my mind. Reading can allow you to be imaginative and think more creatively. Things technology can sometimes prevent your from doing. I was definitely more creative as a kid,  and like I said, I want to get back to that.

                At the start of this year, I set a goal to read at least one book a month (starting off small, you have to start at some point). LOL, but I’ve been stuck on the same book “The Song of Achilles” since January, it’s May. I think it is a pretty good book but haven’t been able really sit down and read the way that I want to.   
            </p>
            <p> 
                I think the hardest part about reading, is starting and getting into it. The problem with is that I don’t really know what type of stories I like. Now that I will have a little bit more free-time I hope to continue this passion pursuit and start exploring different genres, and hopefully start reading and finishing books.

                Gardening is something my grandma loves to do; it gives her peace and a purpose. When I look at her gardening it’s amazing how much care she gives to each plant, as if she names each of them. I’ve always admired the tranquility and peace that comes from the cat of gardening.
            <p>
                Because I’m not in the right environment to start a whole garden, I decided to first adopt a plant with my roommate. Her name is Beatrice, and she is very easy to take of  care. We water her every couple of days. Sometimes we forget, but she’s a strong one so she always comes right back.     
            </p>
            <p> 
                I do enjoy the thought of gardening, but I think I need to be at a different stage in my life to really provide my undivided attention to it. Will I continue this passion project? maybe later down the line.
