             Welcome to What’s My Passion Weekly! In the process of finding a passion, and ultimately start a passion project, I’ll need to start trying new things, and revisiting old things I haven’t done in a while. With this segment I will be writing about all the activities I’ve tried to pursue throughout the week, how I feel about them and whether I view them as a passion project personally. Some things may not stick for me, but they might stick for you. Let’s start finding or passion!

        <h2> MY FIRST PASSION PURSUIT  </h2>
        <p> 
            This maybe cheating, but I will consider this (blog) my first passion pursuit. I’ve always wanted to develop my own website, and this is perfect opportunity to do it. There are so many ways to be creative with your website and blog, from developing it, designing it, and creating content. I’ve always been interested in developing a website, utilizing my coding knowledge, and designing utilizing my graphic design knowledge, but if you’re not keen on either of those things, and you want to make content there are so many platforms that allow you to do just that.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally want to try and do all of the nitty gritty from the website development to the designing. This could potentially be a great way for me to be creative in a lot of different ways. I have a pretty basic knowledge in coding, but I am actively taking classes to get better. I’ve done graphic design before, but I haven’t done it in a while. This opportunity seems like the right time to get better at both these skills. This could also help me out careers wise (Not that a passion project has to connect to your career goals) but I do hope to be in the digital marketing space, so enhancing my skill would definitely be a plus.   
        </p>

            So how do I feel about this passion pursuit? Well, I see a lot of potential, this could definitely help me in a lot of ways in terms of self-fulfillment, and  enhanced creativity, and I already have an interest in what it takes to create and manage a website. BUT commitment is key to this, so we’ll see. If you’re still reading these blogs than I’d say this passion pursuit is a success.
