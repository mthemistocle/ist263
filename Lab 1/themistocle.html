    </head>
    <body>My name is Meghan Themistocle, I am pursuing a major in Marketing and Information Management and Technology, with an interest in digital and web development related to entertainment, film, and tv. Iâ€™ve been able to intern Paramount Global under the Nickelodeon division, honing my digital marketing skills. Outside of work I enjoy binge watch tv shows and movies, cooking, sports, specifically basketball and soccer, and lastly making pottery. I am excited to take class as I have an interest in web development. </body>
